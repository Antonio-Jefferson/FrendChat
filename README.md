# Friend-Chat

Implementation of a fully functional chat, inspired by the late UOL Chat. But avoid using the real UOL website as a reference, because, despite being inspired by it, the interface is totally different.


## Installation

How to run the project on your machine:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Antonio-Jefferson/FrendChat.git
```
Open the file:
```bash
  cd folder-name
```
Open the index.js file in the browser
## ðŸ›  Skills
The FriendChat mobile site project will be implemented using the following technologies:

- <span style="background-color: yellow">JavaScript</span>: The main programming language for the site logic.
- <span style="background-color: orange">HTML</span>: Used to structure the content of the site.
- <span style="background-color: blue">CSS</span>: Responsible for styling and visual appearance of the site.


## Features

- Join Room: Users can enter the chat room by entering their name. The system verifies that the name is already in use and allows users to enter the room with unique names.

- Send messages: Users can send messages to the chat room. Messages are displayed to all chat participants in real time.

- View online users: The system displays the list of online users in the chat room. Users can see who is active and participating in the conversation.
